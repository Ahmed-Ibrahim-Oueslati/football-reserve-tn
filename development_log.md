## ü§ñ AI Tool Usage Strategy

### Primary AI Tools

#### 1. **Cursor IDE** - Primary Development Environment
- **Usage**: Real-time code completion, refactoring, debugging
- **Strengths**: Context-aware suggestions, file understanding
- **Best For**: Component development, API routes, TypeScript interfaces

**Effective Prompts for Cursor:**
```
"Generate a TypeScript React component for displaying football field cards with weather integration. Include proper types, error handling, and Tailwind styling."

"Create a Prisma query to find available time slots for a field on a specific date, excluding existing reservations."

"Refactor this component to use React Query for data fetching with proper loading and error states."
```

#### 2. **GitHub Copilot** - Code Completion
- **Usage**: Autocomplete functions, generate boilerplate code
- **Strengths**: Pattern recognition, quick implementations
- **Best For**: Utility functions, validation schemas, test cases

#### 3. **Claude (Anthropic)** - Architecture & Complex Logic
- **Usage**: System design, complex business logic, documentation
- **Strengths**: Understanding context, explaining concepts
- **Best For**: Database design, API architecture, integration patterns

#### 4. **CodeRabbit** - Code Review & Quality
- **Usage**: PR reviews, code quality checks, suggestion improvements
- **Strengths**: Automated reviews, best practice recommendations
- **Best For**: Code review automation, release notes generation

## üéØ AI Prompt Templates & Best Practices

### Component Generation Template
```
Context: Football field reservation app for Tunis with weather integration
Task: Generate a [component type] component that [specific functionality]
Requirements:
- TypeScript with proper interfaces
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Error handling and loading states
- Mobile-responsive design
- Integration with [specific API/service]
Tech Stack: Next.js 14, Prisma, OpenWeatherMap API
```

### API Route Generation Template
```
Create a Next.js API route for [endpoint description]
Methods: [GET/POST/PUT/DELETE]
Input validation: Use Zod schemas
Database: Prisma with [relevant models]
Error handling: Return proper HTTP status codes
Response format: JSON with TypeScript interfaces
Business logic: [specific requirements]
```

### Testing Template
```
Generate comprehensive tests for [component/function name]
Test cases should cover:
- Happy path scenarios
- Error conditions
- Edge cases
- User interactions (if applicable)
Testing framework: Jest + React Testing Library
Mock external dependencies: [API calls, database, etc.]
```

## üîÑ Iterative Improvement Log

### AI Prompt Refinements
1. **Initial Prompt**: "Create a booking component"
   - **Issue**: Too vague, generic output
   - **Improved**: "Create a football field booking component with date/time selection, weather display, and form validation using our Prisma schema"

2. **Database Query Prompt**: "Get available fields"
   - **Issue**: Didn't consider business logic
   - **Improved**: "Generate Prisma query to find available fields for a specific date/time, excluding conflicting reservations and including weather data"

### Code Generation Patterns
- **Most Effective**: Providing complete context including schema, requirements, and existing patterns
- **Least Effective**: Generic requests without domain-specific context
- **Best Results**: Iterative refinement with specific feedback
