Football Field Reservation App - Planning with AI

> **🎯 Project Planning Phase**: Designing an AI-enhanced development approach for a football field reservation system in Tunis with weather integration

## 🌟 Project Idea

### **Football Field Reservation System for Tunis with Weather Integration**

A web application that allows users to browse and reserve football fields across the three major cities of Tunis (Tunis, Ariana, Ben Arous) with integrated weather forecasting to help users make informed booking decisions.

#### **Why This Project?**
- **Meaningful**: Solves a real problem for football enthusiasts in Tunisia
- **Achievable**: Realistic scope for capstone timeline (7 days)
- **Engaging**: Combines multiple interesting technologies (weather APIs, booking systems, location services)
- **AI-Friendly**: Multiple opportunities for AI-assisted development across different domains

#### **Core Problem Solved**
Currently, booking football fields in Tunis requires calling multiple facilities, with no way to check weather conditions for planned matches. This app centralizes bookings and adds weather intelligence for better decision-making.

## 🤖 AI Integration Plan

### 🧱 **Code or Feature Generation**

#### **Primary AI Tools**: Cursor IDE + GitHub Copilot

**Specific Usage Strategy:**

1. **Component Scaffolding**
   - Use AI to generate React components with proper TypeScript interfaces
   - Generate form components with validation using react-hook-form + Zod
   - Create UI components following Shadcn/ui patterns

2. **API Route Generation**
   - Generate CRUD operations for fields, reservations, and users
   - Create weather API integration functions
   - Generate authentication middleware and route protection

3. **Database Schema & Operations**
   - Use AI to design Prisma schema based on requirements
   - Generate type-safe Prisma queries and mutations
   - Create database seeding scripts with realistic data

4. **Business Logic Functions**
   - Weather-based booking recommendations algorithm
   - Availability checking and conflict resolution
   - Pricing calculation with weather factors

**Example AI-Generated Features:**
```typescript
// AI will help generate components like this:
interface FieldCardProps {
  field: Field;
  weatherData: WeatherData;
  onReserve: (fieldId: string) => void;
}

const FieldCard: React.FC<FieldCardProps> = ({ field, weatherData, onReserve }) => {
  // AI-generated component logic
};
```

### 🧪 **Testing Support**

#### **AI-Assisted Testing Strategy:**

1. **Unit Test Generation**
   - Generate tests for utility functions (date validation, price calculations)
   - Create tests for weather API integration functions
   - Generate validation schema tests using Zod

2. **Component Testing**
   - Use AI to create React Testing Library tests
   - Generate user interaction tests (form submissions, button clicks)
   - Create accessibility and responsive design tests

3. **API Integration Tests**
   - Generate tests for all CRUD operations
   - Create authentication flow tests
   - Generate weather API mock responses and tests

4. **Test Data Generation**
   - AI-generated realistic test data for fields, users, reservations
   - Mock weather data for different conditions
   - Edge case test scenarios

**Sample AI Testing Prompt:**
```
"Generate comprehensive Jest tests for a football field reservation validation function that checks:
- Date is not in the past
- Time slot doesn't conflict with existing bookings
- Field is available during requested hours
- Weather conditions meet playability requirements
Include edge cases and error scenarios."
```

### 📡 **Schema-Aware or API-Aware Generation**

#### **Prisma Schema-Driven Development:**

1. **Type-Safe Database Operations**
   - Use Prisma schema to generate TypeScript types
   - AI will create functions based on schema relationships
   - Generate CRUD operations that respect foreign key constraints

2. **API Route Generation Based on Schema**
   - Create RESTful endpoints following OpenAPI specifications
   - Generate request/response validation based on Prisma models
   - Create middleware for data transformation and serialization

3. **Weather API Integration**
   - Generate TypeScript interfaces from OpenWeatherMap API documentation
   - Create wrapper functions that transform external API responses to internal types
   - Build caching layer for weather data based on API response structure

**Schema-Aware Example:**
```prisma
// Prisma schema will drive AI code generation
model Field {
  id            String        @id @default(cuid())
  name          String
  city          City
  reservations  Reservation[]
}

model Reservation {
  id       String @id @default(cuid())
  fieldId  String
  field    Field  @relation(fields: [fieldId], references: [id])
}
```

AI will generate functions like:
```typescript
// Auto-generated based on schema relationships
async function getFieldWithReservations(fieldId: string): Promise<FieldWithReservations> {
  // AI-generated Prisma query with proper types
}
```

## 🔧 In-Editor/PR Review Tooling Plan

```

#### **2. API Development Prompt**
```
"Create a Next.js API route for handling football field reservations with these specifications:
- Method: POST /api/reservations
- Input validation using Zod schema
- Check for booking conflicts using Prisma queries
- Integrate weather data from OpenWeatherMap API
- Send confirmation email using Nodemailer
- Return proper HTTP status codes and error messages
- Include TypeScript interfaces for request/response
- Implement proper error handling and logging

Database schema context: [provide relevant Prisma models]
Authentication: Uses NextAuth.js with JWT tokens"
```

#### **3. Testing Generation Prompt**
```
"Generate a comprehensive test suite for the football field availability checking function with:
- Unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library
- Test cases for date validation (no past dates)
- Conflict detection with existing reservations
