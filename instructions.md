give me the steps to do this with an ai ide : üß™ Capstone Part 2: Development & Implementation
This is where you bring your project to life using AI as your assistant‚Äînot your autopilot.
üéØ Goal
Build a functional, complete project while applying the AI planning strategy you created. You‚Äôll use your IDE, AI tools, and context-aware prompting techniques to accelerate development.
üõ†Ô∏è What You‚Äôll Do
1. Build Core Features Implement the features outlined in your plan. Let AI help with:
   * Scaffolding boilerplate or logic
   * Writing tests
   * Writing docstrings and comments
   * Fixing bugs or errors
2. Review and Iterate Use AI-powered IDE assistants (e.g., CodeRabbit, Cursor, Zed) to:
   * Suggest code improvements
   * Generate changelogs
   * Review code before commits or PRs
   * Rewrite unclear logic or comments
3. Use Version Control Thoughtfully
   * Commit frequently with clear messages
   * Label or describe which parts were AI-generated
   * Optionally submit one PR using AI-generated summaries
4. Final Touches
   * Clean up any redundant code
   * Add README instructions, usage examples, and screenshots
   * Add a short reflection on how AI supported or challenged you
Tasks
0. Capstone Development
mandatory
Deliverable:
1. Push your full project to your GitHub repository created in the planning phase.
2. Your repo must include:
   * üìÅ A functional codebase, clearly structured (e.g., /src, /components, /api, /docs)
   * üìÑ An updated README.md with:
      * Setup and run instructions
      * Features implemented
      * Technologies used
      * Notes on AI usage (tools and contexts)
   * üìå A reflection.md with:
      * A 500-word reflection on how AI impacted your build process
      * What worked well, what felt limiting, and what you learned about prompting, reviewing, and iterating
3. ‚úÖ Commit Guidelines:
   * Use AI to generate commit messages where possible (e.g., CodeRabbit or IDE support)
   * Keep commits focused and well-labeled (e.g., feat: add vote-on-poll logic)
4. üß† AI Workflows You Should Show Evidence Of:
   * Prompting AI to generate endpoint clients from API Spec document (API-aware AI)
   * Using in-IDE AI to scaffold features, tests, and documentation
   * Performing AI-powered code reviews before pushing (e.g., with CodeRabbit)
   * Revising README or docstrings with suggestions from your assistant
5. üì∏ Optional Enhancements:
   * Include screenshots of your editor showing AI interactions
   * Add a short demo video or link

Here's your complete roadmap for building the football field reservation app using AI-enhanced development:

üéØ Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation (Day 1)
Step 1: Repository Creation
bash
# Create and clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tunis-football-reservation.git
cd tunis-football-reservation

# Initialize Next.js project with AI assistance
ü§ñ AI Prompt for Cursor:

"Set up a Next.js 14 project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and the following dependencies for a football field reservation app with weather integration:
- @prisma/client and prisma
- next-auth
- @hookform/resolvers and react-hook-form
- zod for validation
- axios for API calls
- @radix-ui components for shadcn/ui

Create the initial folder structure following Next.js 13+ app router conventions."
Step 2: Database Schema Design
ü§ñ AI Prompt for Cursor:

"Generate a Prisma schema for a football field reservation system with the following models:
- User (id, name, email, phone, role, createdAt, updatedAt)
- Field (id, name, description, city enum[TUNIS, ARIANA, BEN_AROUS], address, lat, lng, pricePerHour, capacity, surfaceType, facilities array, images array, isActive)
- Reservation (id, fieldId, userId, date, startTime, endTime, totalPrice, status enum, weatherData json, notes)
- FieldAvailability (id, fieldId, dayOfWeek, openTime, closeTime)
- WeatherCache (id, city, date, weatherData json, expiresAt)

Include proper relationships and indexes for performance."
Step 3: Environment Setup
ü§ñ AI Prompt:

"Create a complete .env.example file with all required environment variables for:
- PostgreSQL database connection
- NextAuth configuration
- OpenWeatherMap API key
- SMTP email settings
- Google Maps API (optional)

Also create a comprehensive .gitignore file for Next.js with additional entries for our specific dependencies."
üìù Commit Message (AI-Generated):

bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: initial project setup with Next.js, Prisma schema, and environment configuration

- Configure Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Add Prisma schema for fields, reservations, and weather data
- Set up environment variables and database configuration
- Initialize project structure with app router conventions"
üèóÔ∏è Phase 2: Core Feature Development (Days 2-4)
Step 4: Database Operations & API Routes
ü§ñ AI Prompt for API Generation:

"Generate Next.js 14 API routes with the following specifications:

1. GET /api/fields - List fields with optional filters (city, date, facilities)
2. GET /api/fields/[id] - Get field details with availability slots
3. POST /api/reservations - Create new reservation with validation
4. GET /api/reservations - Get user reservations with filtering
5. GET /api/weather/forecast - Get weather forecast for specific city and date

Each route should:
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces
- Include Zod validation for request bodies
- Handle errors with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Use Prisma for database operations
- Include proper authentication checks where needed
- Return consistent JSON response format

Context: Using Prisma with PostgreSQL, NextAuth for authentication, OpenWeatherMap API for weather data."

- Cache weather data for 10 minutes to avoid API limits
- Handle API errors gracefully with fallback data
- Transform API response to our internal WeatherData interface

Include proper TypeScript types and error handling. Use the city coordinates:
- TUNIS: lat=36.8065, lon=10.1815
- ARIANA: lat=36.8625, lon=10.1955  
- BEN_AROUS: lat=36.7545, lon=10.2301"
